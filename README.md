## Overview

This project implements a **mini asset management system** for the NUST Facilities Directorate using **Ballerina**.  
It allows staff to:

- Create, update, view, and delete assets
- View assets by faculty
- Manage components, maintenance schedules, work orders, and tasks
- Check overdue maintenance schedules
- Persist data across restarts in a JSON file (`assets_db.json`)
- Receive proper HTTP status codes for each operation

The service runs on **http://localhost:8080/assets**.
